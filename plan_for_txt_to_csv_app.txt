Information Gathered:
- User wants an online app to convert TXT files to CSV with AI-based capabilities.
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with drag-and-drop, file upload, download, and clear instructions.
- Backend: PHP to handle file upload, conversion logic, file deletion, and security.
- Conversion logic must handle different TXT formats (varied delimiters, multiline data).
- Security: auto-delete uploaded files after conversion, clear privacy info.
- Scalability: design to allow adding other file formats in future.
- Optional: cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox) - can be planned for later.

Plan:
1. Frontend:
   - index.html: main UI with file upload input, drag-and-drop area, instructions, and download button.
   - styles.css: clean, minimal styling for UI.
   - script.js: handle file upload, drag-and-drop, send file to backend via AJAX, receive converted CSV, trigger download.
   - Include clear textual/visual instructions and info about TXT vs CSV.

2. Backend:
   - upload.php: handle file upload securely, validate file type and size.
   - convert.php: process uploaded TXT file, parse content with flexible delimiter detection, convert to CSV format.
   - delete.php or integrated cleanup: delete uploaded files after conversion or after a short time.
   - Return CSV file for download.

3. Security & Privacy:
   - Limit file size.
   - Validate file types.
   - Auto-delete files after processing.
   - Display privacy policy info on frontend.

4. Extensibility:
   - Design backend conversion logic modularly to add other formats later.
   - Frontend UI designed to allow adding more file format options.

Dependent Files to be created:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- upload.php
- convert.php
- (optional) cleanup.php or integrated cleanup logic

Follow-up Steps:
- Implement frontend and backend files.
- Test file upload, conversion, download, and security features.
- Optionally add cloud storage integration later.
- Deploy on a PHP-capable web server.
